# Mood Thieves

## Description
Mood thieves roam the streets.
As soon as they spot someone in a good mood, they immediately steal that good mood and disappear to the laboratory, where they transform the stolen mood into illegal chewing gum.

There are K thieves involved in this operation.
There are indistinguishable resources S for mood theft equipment available, as well as a Laboratory with N indistinguishable workstations.
A thief takes 1 piece of equipment, then randomly travels around the city for a certain amount of time.
Randomly, they may encounter someone in a good mood, and in that case, they occupy 1 workstation in the laboratory.
The equipment is not immediately released after use - it is set aside and takes some time to regain its power before returning to the pool of available resources.
